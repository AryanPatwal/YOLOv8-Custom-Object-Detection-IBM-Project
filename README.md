# YOLOv8-Custom-Object-Detection-IBM-Project
This project demonstrates end-to-end training, validation, and inference of a custom object detection model using YOLOv8. It includes dataset setup, YAML configuration, model training, performance evaluation, and prediction generation. Built as part of an IBM project, it provides a clear workflow for real-world computer vision tasks.
